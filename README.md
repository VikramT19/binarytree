Project Overview

This project implements a binary tree data structure in Java. A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. The implementation supports basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

src/: Contains the source code for the binary tree implementation.
test/: Includes test cases for the binary tree.
evosuite-tests/: EvoSuite-generated test cases.
junit-tests/: JUnit test cases.
randoop-tests/: Randoop-generated test cases.

Usage

Building the Project

To build the project, you can use a Java build tool like Maven or Gradle. Here's an example using Maven:

mvn clean install

Running Tests

The project includes tests generated by EvoSuite, JUnit, and Randoop. You can run the tests individually or together. For example:


# Run EvoSuite tests
mvn evosuite:generate evosuite:test

# Run JUnit tests
mvn test

# Run Randoop tests
mvn randoop:test

Implementation Details

The binary tree implementation is located in the src/ directory. It consists of classes representing the binary tree, tree nodes, and the main operations such as insertion and deletion.

Testing Details

EvoSuite

EvoSuite is an automatic test case generation tool. It automatically generates JUnit test cases for your code. EvoSuite-generated tests can be found in the test/evosuite-tests/ directory.

JUnit

JUnit is a widely used testing framework for Java. JUnit tests can be found in the test/junit-tests/ directory.

Randoop

Randoop is an automatic test generation tool. It creates random sequences of method calls to find and report errors. Randoop-generated tests can be found in the test/randoop-tests/ directory.
