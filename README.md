# Binary Tree Implementation

This Java project provides an implementation of a binary tree along with comprehensive testing using EvoSuite, JUnit, and Randoop.

# Project Overview

This project implements a binary tree data structure in Java. A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. The implementation supports basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

# Running Tests

The project includes tests generated by EvoSuite, JUnit, and Randoop. You can run the tests individually or together. For example:

# Run EvoSuite tests
mvn evosuite:generate evosuite:test

# Run JUnit tests
mvn test

# Run Randoop tests
mvn randoop:test

# Testing Details

EvoSuite

EvoSuite is an automatic test case generation tool. It automatically generates JUnit test cases for your code. EvoSuite-generated tests can be found in the test/evosuite-tests/ directory.

JUnit

JUnit is a widely used testing framework for Java. JUnit tests can be found in the test/junit-tests/ directory.

Randoop

Randoop is an automatic test generation tool. It creates random sequences of method calls to find and report errors. Randoop-generated tests can be found in the test/randoop-tests/ directory.
